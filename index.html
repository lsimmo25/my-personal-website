      <p>Hello! My name is Lyle Simmons. I will be starting the SE self paced cohort on January 29th 2024. I come from a slightly different tech background. I worked in IT and have a Bachelors Degree in Digital Science. I graduated from Kent State University and am currently a Customer Support Supervisor for a software company. Software Engineering was always my dream and actually my original major in college. I've decided to take the step to make a career change and start persuing that dream and am excited to begin learning here at Flatiron!</p>
